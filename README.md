A web-hosted service that will match you to restaurants based on your current location and time.
We also aim to add a deeper functionality to consider user preferences for restaurant recommendations and suggestions.
Developing user and restaurant profiles will make the entire user experience more intuitive and frienly, while making the entire process easier to use.
