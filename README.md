According to a study conducted by the National Library of Medicine in 2018, North American college students were more prone to unhealthy eating habits, which over prolonged periods of time, led to severe mental health issues. Having recently started university, we’ve also begun to understand the significance a healthy diet plays in critical thinking, keeping up with classwork, and even maintaining a social life. Although, is it really feasible for newly transitioning university students to pay mind to their eating habits, considering the expectations and responsibilities placed on them? What about those who may still remain unfamiliar with the best, safest, and most accommodating places to eat around them? Is eating healthy easy for such audiences?

FOODAR is a web-hosted service that will match you to restaurants based on your current location and time. Currently, it takes in any US location, and produces the name, location, and website of the top 3 restaurants with those given parameters.

FUTURE GOALS:
Specify the Search
We want to add more parameters to the search to make it more specific to the user’s location, and perhaps travel time limitations
User Preferences
We want to customize the experience for our users. Thus, adding more parameters to the search (i.e. spice levels, cuisine type) will ensure a personalized experience for the users.
Restaurant Profiles
To take this a step further, restaurants with large demonstrated interest can establish their own customizable profiles on the webpage for consumers to view.
Developing user and restaurant profiles will make the entire user experience more intuitive and frienly, while making the entire process easier to use.
